# Python-Text-Parser
This program extracts all the text from a text file. The punctuation is removed from the text and stored as entries in an array for data processing. This array is parsed and the unique words are placed in a separate array and tallied for statistic purposes. This program also has a discord bot implementation of the program on a separate branch.
